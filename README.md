<h1>Single Tower Defence 2D</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Simple tower defence project. Defeat your enemies to make gold and upgrade weapons and castle with it. I was trying to make this game in a gamejam spirit but I used a much more time to find assets than I should in a real gamejam. Every asset is free and commercial use ready. You can use gamepad to play but it is not recommended experience.
